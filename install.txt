# missing dependancies (not installing atm, custom code was added to reop insted to read pfm): pip install pypfm

#you might suffer from GPU memory issues from a bug in the ray lib when the models are being initialized and the batch size is smaller than 32.
#We suggest to replace:
#        sample_batch_size = max(self.batch_divisibility_req * 4, 32)
#by
#        sample_batch_size = self.batch_divisibility_req 
#in initialize_loss_from_dummy_batch in ray/rllib/policy/policy.py
